
Using ITypeInfo to try to get private class function address from vtable
in IDE ITypeInfo implementation is in vba6.dll
once compiled it is in msvbvm60.dll

the vb vm implementation is not a full implementation so we then have to parse
internal structures to get at the data...

just for fun/curosity dont actually use this for anything meaningful..
